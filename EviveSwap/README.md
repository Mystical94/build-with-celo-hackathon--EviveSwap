- Shubham Gupta, Blockchain Developer

#### Project Description

##### Idea
- People put their money in banks thinking they have control over it, but in actuality, banks control the money.
- 'Your Money, Your Control,' is the core of Blockchain Technology which is how Decentralized Exchange work under the hood and this has long attracted me. As laws tighten, more people are turning to decentralised exchanges, discovering the actual value of blockchain and decentralised exchanges.
- Banks have unlimited control over money and can even refuse to enable customers to withdraw it in an emergency.
- There is no transparency in the operations of the Banks and everingthing is Centralized
- What's a better way to exchange your money while still having the ability to contribute to the global problems in the form of the fees which you anyhow have to pay to the big Institutions and banks.
- Evive = Evolution + Revive

##### Implementation
- We will fork UniswapV2 and deploy it on the Celo(Alfajores) Blockchain, as well as render our own UI, which will be hosted using Spheron Protocol, and link the smart contracts with the UI, allowing users to interact with the protocol.
- We will also make some modifications to the Uniswap's smart contracts to automatically transmit 0.02% of the total fees each to the four causes, for a total of 0.08% to the global causes, 0.02% to the protocol for continued development and improvement of the protocol, and 0.2% to the liquidity providers for their contribution.
- Solidity, Remix, Celo Blockchain, React, and Metamask will be used as tools.

##### Intended Users
- People who wnat complete authority and transparency over their assets are the intended users as DEXs are decentralized and provides complete transparency and record which is publicaly avaliable to everyone on the Blockchain

#### Summary
- EviveSwap will enable anyone from anywhere in the globe to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies immediately using Celo Blockchain.
- EviveSwap will contribute to four different causes i.e. combating war, fighting biodiversity collapse, climate change and projects working towards ReFi.
- It will not discriminate and will be open to everyone.
- EviveToken can be earned by providing liquidity and earning a steady passive income.
